# Glossary

This section documents the vocabulary mapping between SDMX 3.* and DPM Refit (2.0). It is the first comprehensive draft of the glossary mapping.

It aims to:
- Explain how core SDMX vocabulary artefacts correspond to DPM artefacts.
- Provide practical rules and conventions to generate a DPM glossary from SDMX structures.
- Highlight known limitations and information-loss points that will need explicit handling.
