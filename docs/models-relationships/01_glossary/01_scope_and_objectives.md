# 1. Scope and objectives

- **Scope**
    - Vocabulary artefacts only: codelists, codes, concept schemes, concepts and hierarchies (SDMX); categories, category items, subcategories, properties, metrics and related glossary artefacts (DPM).
    - SDMX version 3.* and DPM Refit 2.0, using the information models and examples in the background documents.
    - Primary focus on “core mapping”; details that are primarily about data structures, rendering or validation are treated in other sections.

- **Objectives**

    - Provide a clear, traceable mapping between SDMX and DPM vocabulary artefacts.
    - Serve as the basis for:
        - the [data definition mapping](../02_data_definition/index.md), and
        - the algorithmic transformations in the transformation guidelines.
    - Document constraints and open questions that affect interoperability.
