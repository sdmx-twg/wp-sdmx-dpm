# Other Artifacts

Relate higher-level organisational and rendering artifacts across SDMX and DPM.

## Scope
- Map SDMX Reporting Taxonomies to DPM Report Modules (groupings of flows/tables).
- Note DPM rendering-specific artifacts (table headers, cells, rows, columns) that lack direct SDMX equivalents.
- Capture supporting constructs (e.g., organisational groupings, presentation artefacts) needed for consistent navigation between models.

## Open items
- Decide how much of the rendering layer to surface in the public documentation vs keep as implementation detail.
- Identify examples that show modular grouping across both standards.
