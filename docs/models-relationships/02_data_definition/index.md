# Data Definition

Describe how SDMX dataflows and structures correspond to DPM report tables and variables.

## Scope
- Convention: one SDMX Dataflow plus one DSD corresponds to one DPM Report Table.
- Map SDMX components (Dimension, Measure, Attribute) to DPM Key Variables, Fact Variables, and Attribute Variables.
- Explain how DPM variables correspond to SDMX time series identifiers (Cartesian product of allowed values).
- Document common table patterns (SDMX-like table, closed table, open “set axis” table) and their interoperability implications.

## Open items
- Provide worked examples for each table pattern.
- Clarify how constraints/validation artifacts align between SDMX and DPM for these structures.
