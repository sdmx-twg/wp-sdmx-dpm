# Business Case: SDMX-DPM Interoperability Work Package

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the business case for the **SDMX-DPM Interoperability Work Package**, an initiative proposed by the SDMX Technical Working Group (TWG). The primary goal is to establish and document a framework for interoperability between the **Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange (SDMX)** standard and the **Data Point Model (DPM)**.

By bridging the gap between these two dominant standards—SDMX in official statistics and DPM in financial supervision—this work package aims to reduce operational silos, eliminate redundant metadata management, and facilitate seamless data exchange across domains. The output will be a comprehensive set of public resources, including mapping documentation, transformation guidelines, and a dedicated interoperability website, delivered between Q4 2025 and Q3 2026.

## 2. Background and Context

### 2.1. The Challenge: Divergent Standards
Currently, the statistical and supervisory domains operate in parallel but separate ecosystems:
*   **SDMX (Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange)**: The global standard for exchanging statistical data, widely used by central banks and international organizations.
*   **DPM (Data Point Model)**: A data-centric modeling framework primarily used in the European financial supervision context (e.g., EBA, EIOPA) and often implemented via XBRL.

While both frameworks share common concepts—such as dimensional structures, classifications, and reporting requirements—they have evolved independently. This divergence has led to:
*   **Siloed Data**: Difficulty in integrating statistical and supervisory data.
*   **Duplication of Effort**: Reporting agents (e.g., banks) and institutions often maintain separate pipelines and metadata repositories for each standard.
*   **Interoperability Barriers**: Technical challenges in mapping metadata and data structures between systems.

### 2.2. The Mandate
In June 2025, the SDMX TWG reviewed the potential for interoperability between SDMX and DPM. The review concluded that significant synergies exist and that a formal effort to document and operationalize these links would benefit the entire community. This work package was established to execute on that vision.

## 3. Objectives

The core objective of this work package is to make SDMX-DPM interoperability a practical reality for technical and business stakeholders.

### 3.1. Strategic Objectives
*   **Promote Interoperability**: Demonstrate how SDMX and DPM can coexist and interact, enabling cross-domain data flows.
*   **Enhance Metadata Governance**: Advocate for unified glossary approaches where concepts are shared across reporting frameworks, reducing the need for parallel metadata maintenance.
*   **Support Integrated Reporting**: Align with broader industry trends like the Integrated Reporting Framework (IReF) by enabling metadata-driven approaches that span both statistical and prudential requirements.

### 3.2. Deliverable Objectives
The work package is committed to producing tangible assets:
1.  **Business Case**: A formalized articulation of the value proposition (this document).
2.  **Model Relationship Documentation**: Detailed technical mapping of SDMX 3.0 components to DPM 2.0 elements (and vice versa).
3.  **Transformation Guidance**: Practical algorithms and examples for converting metadata and data between formats (including SDMX-CSV and XBRL-CSV).
4.  **Public Knowledge Base**: A standards interoperability website to serve as a permanent reference for the community.

## 4. Scope and Approach

### 4.1. Scope
The work package will focus on:
*   **Conceptual Alignment**: Mapping high-level concepts (Dimensions, Attributes, Measures vs. Key/Fact Variables).
*   **Technical Mapping**: Defining precise transformation rules between SDMX Information Model (v3.0) and DPM Metamodel (v2.0).
*   **Data Formats**: Addressing interoperability at the data instance level, specifically between SDMX-CSV and XBRL-CSV.
*   **Communication**: Translating technical findings into accessible content for a broad audience.

### 4.2. Approach
The project follows a collaborative, phased approach:
*   **Consolidation**: Leveraging existing expert knowledge and the June 2025 presentation as a baseline.
*   **Development**: Drafting technical documents and validating them within the TWG and with DPM experts.
*   **Publication**: Disseminating findings via a dedicated GitHub-based website to ensure accessibility and community engagement.

## 5. Timeline and Phases

The work is structured into five phases, spanning from Q4 2025 to Q3 2026.

| Phase | Activity | Period | Key Deliverables |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Consolidation** | Q4 2025 – Q1 2026 | Collection and refinement of initial materials. |
| **2** | **Business Case Development** | Q1 2026 – Q2 2026 | Finalization of this business case document. |
| **3** | **Model Relationship Documentation** | Q1 2026 – Q3 2026 | Detailed mapping diagrams and tables (SDMX <-> DPM). |
| **4** | **Transformation Guidance** | Q2 2026 – Q3 2026 | Conversion algorithms, case studies, and CSV interoperability guides. |
| **5** | **Website Publication** | Q2 2026 – Q3 2026 | Launch of the [Standards Interoperability Website](https://bis-medit-sdmxio.github.io/data-standards-interoperability/). |

## 6. Conclusion

The SDMX-DPM Interoperability Work Package represents a strategic investment in the future of data exchange. By providing the "missing link" between these two major standards, the project will unlock operational efficiencies, improve data quality, and pave the way for a more integrated global data ecosystem.
